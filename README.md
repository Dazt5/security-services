# Security service project

Project is organized using modules and following **Hexagonal Architecture**:

## Modules:
- code-domain: inside this module are the domain entities, use cases and ports that will interact with the infrastructure.
- adapters-incoming: inside this module we will found the classes that will interact with third-party APIs or handle outside calls.
- adapters-outgoing: there are the data persistence classes and integration with third-party systems.
- app: general project configuration and aspects related to the app infrastructure.

## Database configuration

### Required environment variables:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run the app, you need to set the following env variables related to database configuration:

- `APP_CONTEXTS_ENABLES`: liquibase context, it will decide if app have to run some liquibase scripts e.g `local-dev` / `dev` / `prod`
- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DBMS`: will define the dbms to connect e.g: `postgresql` / `mysql`
- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DB_HOST`: database host e.g: `127.0.0.1`
- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DB_PORT`: database port e.g: `5432` / `3306`
- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DB_NAME`: database name e.g `security_services`
- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DB_USER`: database user e.g `security_services_user`
- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DB_PASSWORD`: user password e.g `autogeneratedPassword`
- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DB_DRIVER`: driver that JPA will use to connect to the database e.g `org.postgresql.Driver` / `org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect`

### Optional environment variables:

> [!TIP]
> In order to be able to run the project, we've created some scripts that will help you to create a postgres database,
> only software needed is docker, this is completely optional.

Inside module `adapters-outgoing/src/main/resource`, there is a docker-compose script with an autoconfigured postgres database.

to complete the setup to use the docker-compose script first you must configure the following env variables:

- `POSTGRES_DEFAULT_USER_NAME`: postgres root user e.g: `postgres`
- `POSTGRES_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD`: postgres root user password e.g `password`

inside folder `adapters-outgoing/src/main/resource/scripts/`, there is a sh script that automatically 
create a database for the project.

After configure these env variables, you should be able to run typing `docker-compose up`, make sure ports set in docker-compose
are available.
