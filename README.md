# Security service project

Project is organized using modules and following **Hexagonal Architecture**:

## Modules:
- <b>code-domain</b>: inside this module are the domain entities, use cases and ports that will interact with the infrastructure.
- <o>adapters-incoming</o>: inside this module we will found the classes that will interact with third-party APIs or handle outside calls.
- <g>adapters-outgoing</g>: there are the data persistence classes and integration with third-party systems.
- <r>app</r>: general project configuration and aspects related to the app infrastructure.

## Database configuration 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to be able to run the project, we've created some scripts that will help you to create a postgres database, 
> only software needed is docker, this is completely optional.

Inside module `adapters-outgoing/src/main/resource`, there is a docker-compose script with an autoconfigured postgres database.

to complete the setup you should configure the following env variables:

- `POSTGRES_DEFAULT_USER_NAME`: postgres root user e.g: `postgres`
- `POSTGRES_DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD`: postgres root user password e.g `password`

inside folder `adapters-outgoing/src/main/resource/scripts/`, there is a sh script that automatically 
create a database for the project. 

- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DB_NAME`: default project database e.g `security_services`
- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DB_USER`: postgres root user password e.g `security_services_user`
- `SECURITY_SERVICES_DB_PASSWORD`: postgres root user password e.g `autogeneratedPassword`

After configure these env variables, you should be able to run typing `docker-compose up`, make sure ports set in docker-compose
are available.
